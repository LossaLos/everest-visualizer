Everest Exploration Website 🌍
        This project is a personal website inspired by the adventure documentary of Inoxtag on Mount Everest. As a student developer,
        I aimed to recreate the spirit of the climb with a 3D interactive visualization of the Everest region. 
        This project serves as a way to explore the camps and summit of Mount Everest using 3D models and interactive markers.
